# Important Notice: Migration to 6.x

We are deprecating the 5.x API on all platforms (except Linux). Release 5.19 in April 2021 will be our final 5.x release. Applications running 5.x will of course continue to work. We will no longer release new features, but will continue to release critical bug fixes and security patches for one year past the 5.19 release date. Access to these security patches is dependent on your support package. We encourage you to migrate to 6.x and take advantage of our latest / advanced features and improved performance. Migration guides on all platforms are available at [docs.scandit.com](docs.scandit.com). As always, please reach out to support@scandit.com with any questions or support migrating your application to 6.x.

The Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK for Cordova (5.x) has been _replaced_ by the new and improved 6.x version, the [Scandit Data Capture SDK for Cordova](https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/cordova/index.html). It's the primary supported and maintained plugin for Cordova and we encourage everyone to upgrade and use the new version going forward.

To learn more about the Scandit Data Capture SDK for Cordova, go to https://docs.scandit.com/data-capture-sdk/cordova/index.html.

# Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK Plugin for Cordova/PhoneGap

Cross platform PhoneGap/Cordova Plugin of the Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK for iOS and Android.

**Important:** This repository does not contain the core library of the Scandit Barcode Scanner since the library can not be publicly distributed. It only contains the classes that wrap the library to create a Cordova plugin and is therefore not an installable Cordova plugin. The actual library is only available from your [Scandit account](https://ssl.scandit.com/main) where you can download the fully installable Cordova plugin that includes the libraries. 

To integrate this plugin into your app please follow [the instructions](http://docs.scandit.com/stable/phonegap/cordova-integrate.html) on the Scandit website. For further information on the plugin and code examples have a look at the [guides and API documentation](http://docs.scandit.com/stable/phonegap/index.html).
